					I'm a web developer with background in civil engineering, coming from the
					Lake Placid area. At the crossroads between creativity and logic, I am
					fueled by inspirational designs, server-side architecture and integration
					of everything in one functional bond. Relentless spirit and curious mind
					persuing new career.

					Coming from the northern part of New York, I enjoy hiking trails or camping
					during summer months. During the winter time, you will find me snowshoeing
					or cross-country skiing through the ADK. If I am not outside, I enjoy
					playing PC games, solving sudoku or working on crossword puzzles.
