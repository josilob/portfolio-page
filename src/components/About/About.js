					I'm an Inquisitive 26 year old civil engineer and full stack web developer

					Coming from the northern part of NY state, I enjoy hiking trails or camping
					during summer months. During the winter time, you will find me snowshoeing
					or cross-country skiing through the ADK. If I am not outside, I am playing
					PC games or working on my web development skills.
